## Question 1.1
I generate 4 samples of size $n=20$ from a $N(3,1)$ distribution and for each of these 4 samples, I test the null hypothesis $H_0:\mu=3$ against the alternative $H_1:\mu\neq3$ using $\alpha=0.1$ as my level of significance.

Whatâ€™s the probability that I falsely reject **at least one** of the four null hypotheses?

**ANSWER:** $1-(1-\alpha)^m=1-0.9^4=$

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ans = 1-0.9^4
ans
```

*Questions 1.2 and 1.3 are easy*

## Question 1.4

- A 1-sample t-test is to compare the mean of a population to a desired value
- A 2-sample t-test is to compare the mean of two populations
- A paired t-test is to compare the mean of two populations that have paired observations
- ANOVA is used when the means of categories want to be compared
  - $T\sim F_{g-1,N-g}$
  - A p-value of **< 0.05** means that there are at least 2 factors of the variable which are different
  
  
## Question 2

- ANOVA Table
  - d_t = g-1
  - d_r = N-g
  - s_t + s_r = s_total
  - mean_sq_t = s_t/d_t
  - mean_sq_r = s_r/d_r
  - f-statistic = mean_sq_t/mean_sq_r
